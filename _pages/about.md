I am an international comparative education scholar whose work focuses on educational equity and governance. Currently, I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Practice at the University of Pittsburghâ€™s School of Education. My research integrates political science and education to address policy coordination and inclusion challenges through evidence-based approaches.

One of my main research projects uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and computational text analysis to examine diversity and inclusion in K-12 textbooks, focusing on how curriculum content reflects and shapes educational outcomes. I also study how intergovernmental cooperation influences educational equity in low- and middle-income countries, with a particular focus on Brazil.

Beyond education, my political science research explores the dynamics of presidential power and systemic barriers to minority representation in Latin America. This includes studying unilateral executive actions in polarized contexts and examining the challenges faced by marginalized groups in accessing political representation. 

I earned a PhD in International Comparative Education from Stanford University and worked as a Postdoctoral Research and Policy Associate at the University of Oxford. I enjoy teaching and mentoring, particularly in areas such as research methodologies, data analysis, and policy evaluation. I have guided students on projects ranging from analyzing education policies in various countries to evaluating public policy initiatives more broadly.
