I am a political scientist whose work focuses on access to quality education and educational policy governance. Currently, I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Practice at the University of Pittsburghâ€™s School of Education. My research bridges political science and education, employing evidence-based approaches to resolve policy coordination challenges and enhance educational access.

One of my main research projects uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and computational text analysis to examine K-12 textbooks, focusing on how curriculum content reflects and shapes educational outcomes. I also study how intergovernmental cooperation influences educational opportunities in low- and middle-income countries, with a particular focus on Brazil. 

Beyond education, my political science research explores the dynamics of presidential power in Latin America. This includes studying unilateral executive actions in polarized contexts and examining access to political representation.  

I earned a PhD in International Comparative Education from Stanford University and served as a Postdoctoral Research and Policy Associate at the University of Oxford. I enjoy teaching and mentoring, particularly in areas such as research methodologies, data analysis, and policy evaluation. I have guided students on projects ranging from analyzing education policies in various countries to evaluating public policy initiatives more broadly.
